Our development motto is "do no harm" which means that we leverage the patterns outlined in WordPress Core and the Gutenberg editor as opposed to creating proprietary features that impede the overall usability of WordPress.

PHOTOPRESS is actively developed on [Github](https://github.com/photopress-dev/photopress-plugin). Please file any bugs, feature, or support requests on Github!
