# PhotoPress: Making WordPress Work for Photographers

An integrated suite of image management and presentation features for WordPress that photographers can use to build beautiful photography centric websites.


## The Goal

The goal of PhotoPress is to make WordPress easy and compelling enough for photographers to use it as their primary web publishing platform instead of turning to other proprietary software/platforms. PhotoPress brings a variety of critical image management and presentation features together into a single, modern, and modular plugin. 

Our development motto is "do no harm" which means that we leverage the patterns outlined in WordPress Core and the Gutenberg editor as opposed to creating proprietary features that impede the overall usability of WordPress.
